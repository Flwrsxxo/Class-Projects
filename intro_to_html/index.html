        <h2>Describing the Game</h2>

        <p>Stardew Valley is a cozy game where to move into a small town to fix up your grandpa's old farm. You grow crops, raise animals, fish,fight monsters in the mines, decorate your farm and home, progress in the villagers stories, friend them, and even eventually get married . Theres not really an end goal but there is a way to "beat the game" by reaching perfection and discovering everything. The game has a pixel like rpg design with calming music. You can play for relaxation or creativity or the goal of completion.</p>

        <h3>Why I Enjoy this Game</h3>
        <p>I enjoy this game because you can honestly spend hours playing and still discover new things. it can be relaxing but also stressful if youre trying to obtain something distinct. I've played this game for a few years and I still havent got bored of it. If you enjoy pixel games or farming simulation games then I reccomend this game. It's much more than your standard farming game.</p>
